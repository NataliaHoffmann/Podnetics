<h1>Podnetics</h1>

<p>Podnetics is a podcast site built by Natalia Hoffmann as to complete multiple assignments for the course COMP2084G – Server-Side 
Scripting using ASP.NET</p>

<p>It provides the following classes: Category, Podcast and Episode.</p>
<p>Each class have its individual properties and we are able to stabilish relationships between the classes. For example, 
a Category has many Podcasts, and a Podcast has many Episodes. This will be necessary to connect to the database in the future.</p>
